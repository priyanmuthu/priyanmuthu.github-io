I'm a **Research Fellow** in **Microsoft Research** India, a guitarist and a writer. An aspiring researcher in Human-Computer Interaction concentrated on interactivity and interface design. In Microsoft Research, I'm currently working on [accessibility](/projects/CodeTalk/) of Programming Environments, a [smarter walking cane](/projects/InteractiveCane/) for Visually Impaired people, a whole new way to [search and interact](/projects/EmailInsights/) with emails, and a safer [asynchronous](/projects/PSharp/) programming language.

Why HCI?
---
Interactivity is a key concern in interface design. I'm form India, where technological penetration, though rising, is not as high as other developed countries. This is due to many reasons like literacy, cultural differences, age etc. But the main concern is usability. My vision is to develop tools and interfaces that can transcend human diversity. I'm currently exploring the coalition of Machine Learning and HCI, which I believe can change the way we interact with the world.
