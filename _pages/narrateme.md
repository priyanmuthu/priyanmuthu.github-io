With boundless imagination running round  
A whole new world inside me  
The last few years were just  
spinning the hamster wheel  
Round and round it went  
blurring the world around   

With millions of color in my head  
I chose only two to paint my world  
Was I scared to be different?  
Or was it easy to be the same?   

But suddenly I looked around  
And found myself insignificant  
Not to the world, but to myself  
I want to be the sun in the sky  
Not a speck of sand in the beach   

When everyone chose the road,  
I decided the mountains  
For I donâ€™t know not about destination  
But I'll sure enjoy the journey.
