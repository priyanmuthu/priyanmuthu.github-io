<p align="justify">Programming in IDEs is a visually intensive experience. Visually impaired developers cannot take full advantage of useful IDEs features due to their reliance on assistive technologies like screen readers, which projects the 2-Dimensional visual information to 1-Dimensional studio stream. We have identified, with the help of ethnographic study, four broad categories of issues:</p>
1. Discoverability
2. Glanceability
3. Alertability
4. Access to real-time Information

<p align="justify">CodeTalk is a visual Studio plugin which systematically solves these problems. We are striving hard to make CodeTalk open-source as quickly as possible, for the VI developer community to benefit the max. Keep an eye on this page more details coming soon.</p>
