PacMan (also named as Pac-Minion), is a revival of the classic Pac-Man game in 3D, implemented using OpenGL. The game has multiple camera viewing modes along with a free-roam camera mode which the user can control during the gameplay. The game also has an automatic Pac-Play which autonomously controls the Pac, using multiple AI algorithms like Minimax and A*. This project is open-sourced in GitHub.
