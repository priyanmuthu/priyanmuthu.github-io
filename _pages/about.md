I'm a **Research Fellow** in **Microsoft Research** India, a guitarist and a writer. An aspiring researcher in Human-Computer Interaction concentrated on interactivity and interface design. In Microsoft Research, I'm currently working on [accessibility](/projects/CodeTalk/) of Programming Environments, a [smarter walking cane](/projects/InteractiveCane/) for Visually Impaired people, a whole new way to [search and interact](/projects/EmailInsights/) with emails, and a safer [asynchronous](/projects/PSharp/) programming language.

Why HCI?

Over the years, technology has deeply pervaded human life. Still it is nascent in being inclusive - be it diverse cultures, age-groups, physical abilities or even economic backgrounds. My vision is to explore the coalition of Human Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, and Human-Computer Interaction to build interfaces and tools for the next billion users.

I also indulge deeply in [Art](/art/). I collaborate in [*The Onion Art Project*](https://theonionart.wordpress.com){:target="_blank"} and maintain two personal blogs : [*Broken Typewriter*](https://priyanmuthu.wordpress.com){:target="_blank"} and [*Snippets*](https://microsnips.wordpress.com){:target="_blank"}.
